"Someone left me......"

# A New Start

The memories of past few years reshaped my life and mind. My loved one left me.  
I handed over most of my life things and heart to her, which means I have nothing left for myself.  
I have to start a new life, with the begining of my doctoral program, as a researcher,  
**I, HAVE TO CHART A NEW PATH**.  
For my family, for the one I still love, for my friends, for junior students I teach, and for myself.  
This blog is one of my attempts, attempts to live a new life--just working harder, working smarter and chasing the goal harder.
